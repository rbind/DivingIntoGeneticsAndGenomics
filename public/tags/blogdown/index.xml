      <description>Why guest posting? I want to write more hands-on tutorials, but I realized:
 I am not an expert for every data type. I am too busy to write new ones.  So that&amp;rsquo;s why I started to experiment guest posting!
If you want to do a guest posting in my blog which gets 30k views per month, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
I love to collaborate and share knowledge!</description>

      <description>It is almost the end of 2018. It is a good time to review what I have achieved during the year and look forward to a brand new 2019. I wrote a similar post for 2017 here.
Some highlights of the year 2018:  My son Noah Tang was born in April. He is so lovely and we love him so much. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe he is almost 9 months old.</description>

      <description>I have used blogdown writing regular markdown posts, but the real power is from the Rmarkdown! let me try it for this post.
Note that you do not knit the Rmarkdown by yourself, rather you let blogdown do the heavy lift.
