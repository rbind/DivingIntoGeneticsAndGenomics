      <description>Hey everyone, it’s Tommy here. If you’ve been following my blog or my Twitter/X (@tangming2005), you know I love diving into the practical side of bioinformatics and genomics.
Recently, I gave a talk titled “Good Enough Practices for Reproducible Computing” at Moderna, where I spent a good chunk of time chatting about reproducible computing.
Why? Because in our field, where data is exploding and analyses get complex, making sure your work can be repeated—by you or anyone else—is a game-changer.</description>

AI is transforming every field — and bioinformatics is no exception. From designing drug molecules in minutes to writing entire pipelines, generative AI is making it faster than ever to process biological data. But here’s the truth:
 AI doesn’t understand biology — you do.
 That’s why, in this new era, your value isn’t replaced by AI — it’s multiplied by your ability to judge, validate, and improve what AI produces.</description>

Suna was 28. She had melanoma. Chemo left her wrecked—her hair gone, her strength gone, and her hope fading. Doctors gave her weeks.
Then they tried something different.
It didn’t poison the tumor. It didn’t cut or burn. It woke up her immune system.
Her own T-cells found the cancer. Attacked it. Killed it.</description>

What is partial correlation Partial correlation measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of one or more other variables.
Suppose you want to know how X and Y are related, independent of how both are influenced by Z. Partial correlation helps answer:
 If we remove the influence of Z, is there still a connection between X and Y?</description>

      <description>You Can Change Your Appetites Linear algebra, statistics, machine learning—these used to feel abstract to me. I had zero experience of bioinformatics when I was studying my PhD in a wet lab.
I memorized formulas without truly understanding them. But over time, I found the right resources that made these concepts click, especially in the context of bioinformatics.
I wrote a blog post: My opinionated selection of books/urls for bioinformatics/data science curriculum six years ago, and many links are broken.</description>

what is PCA? Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a mathematical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving the most important patterns in the data.
It transforms the original high-dimensional data into a smaller set of new variables called principal components (PCs), which capture the most variation in the data.</description>

      <description>In a biotech startup, an early data strategy is key to ensure public and private data remain useful and valuable. As AI hype reaches new heights, I want to emphasize that a data strategy must precede any AI strategy.
Data is the oil of the AI engine. Unfortunately, the real-world data are usually messy and not AI-ready. Without a robust data strategy, you are building an AI system on a shaky foundation.</description>

My regret is not learning linear algebra well during college.
I barely passed the exam for it (and calculus, it was a nightmare :) ).
To be fair..
It was not taught well and it sounded too boring. I did not know what the application of matrix multiplication was, not until…
Many years later, I started to learn bioinformatics.</description>

Motivation What’s the most common problem you need to solve when dealing with genomics data?
For me, it is Genomic Intervals!
The genomics data usually represents linearly: chromosome name, start and end.
We use it to define a region in the genome ( A peak from ChIP-seq data); the location of a gene, a DNA methylation site ( a single point), a mutation call (a single point), and a duplication region in cancer etc.</description>

Common mistakes in general  Off-by-One Errors:  Mistakes occur when switching between different indexing systems. For example, BED files are 0-based while GFF/GTF files are 1-based, leading to potential misinterpretations of genomic coordinates.   This is one of the most common mistakes!</description>

For single-cell RNAseq quality control, what’s the cutoff for mitochondrial content?
My answer is always: it depends. I was joking: determining a cutoff is 90% of the work a bioinformatician does.
Why is that?

      <description>Context and Problem In scRNA-seq, each cell is sequenced individually, allowing for the analysis of gene expression at the single-cell level. This provides a wealth of information about the cellular identities and states. However, the high dimensionality of the data (thousands of genes) and the technical noise in the data can lead to challenges in accurately clustering the cells. Over-clustering is one such challenge, where cells that are biologically similar are clustered into distinct clusters.</description>

      <description>By the end of every year, I write a review of the past year. It is a great time to reflect on the Losses and Wins and plan for the new year. I can not believe 2024 is right at the corner. My review of 2022 can be found at https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/review-2022/.
Goals reached for 2023 This is in the same order of the goals of 2023 in my last year’s review.</description>

      <description>In this post, we are going to try a CITE-seq normalization method called dsb published in Normalizing and denoising protein expression data from droplet-based single cell profiling
 two major components of protein expression noise in droplet-based single cell experiments: (1) protein-specific noise originating from ambient, unbound antibody encapsulated in droplets that can be accurately estimated via the level of “ambient” ADT counts in empty droplets,
  and (2) droplet/cell-specific noise revealed via the shared variance component associated with isotype antibody controls and background protein counts in each cell.</description>

      <description>Introduction A state-of-the-art method called CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) allows surface protein levels and RNA expression to be measured simultaneously in individual cells. CITE-seq uses traditional single-cell RNA-sequencing to read out both transcriptome and proteomic information from the same cell after labeling it with oligo-conjugated antibodies. This gets over the drawbacks of techniques that just test proteins or RNA separately. CITE-seq reveals coordinated control of gene and protein activity, offering a potent multidimensional perspective of cell states.</description>

      <description>If you ask me: what’s your favorite machine learning algorithm? I would answer logistic regression (with regularization: Lasso, Ridge and Elastic) followed by random forest. In fact, that’s how we try those methods in order. Deep learning can perform well for tabular data with complicated architecture while random forest or boost tree based method usually work well out of the box. Regression and random forest are more interpretable too.</description>

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is probably one of the most well-known large-scale cancer sequencing project. It sequenced ~10,000 treatment-naive tumors across 33 cancer types. Different data including whole-exome, whole-genome, copy-number (SNP array), bulk RNAseq, protein expression (Reverse-Phase Protein Array), DNA methylation are available.
TCGA is a very successful large sequencing project. I highly recommend learning from the organization of it.</description>

      <description>The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a special molecule found on the surface of a type of immune cell called a T-cell. Think of T-cells like soldiers in your body’s defense system that help identify and attack foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria.
The TCR is like a sensor or antenna that allows T-cells to recognize specific targets, kind of like how a key fits into a lock. When the TCR encounters a target it recognizes, it sends signals to the T-cell telling it to attack and destroy the invader.</description>

      <guid>/post/how-to-create-pseudobulk-from-single-cell-rnaseq-data/</guid>
      <description>What is pseduobulk? Many of you have heard about bulk-RNAseq data. What is pseduobulk?
Single-cell RNAseq can profile the gene expression at single-cell resolution. For differential expression, psedobulk seems to perform really well(see paper muscat detects subpopulation-specific state transitions from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data). To create a pseudobulk, one can artificially add up the counts for cells from the same cell type of the same sample.
In this blog post, I’ll guide you through the art of creating pseudobulk data from scRNA-seq experiments.</description>

      <description>Multi-omics data analysis is a cutting-edge approach in biology that involves studying and integrating information from multiple biological “omics” sources. These omics sources include genomics (genes and their variations), transcriptomics (gene expression and RNA data), proteomics (proteins and their interactions), metabolomics (small molecules and metabolites), epigenomics (epigenetic modifications), and more. By analyzing data from various omics levels together, we can gain a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of biological systems and their complexities.</description>

      <description>Introductioon In scRNA-seq data analysis, one of the most crucial and demanding tasks is determining the optimal resolution and cluster number. Achieving an appropriate balance between over-clustering and under-clustering is often intricate, as it directly impacts the identification of distinct cell populations and biological insights.
The clustering algorithms have many parameters to tune and it can generate more clusters if e.g., you increase the resolution parameter. However, whether the newly generated clusters are meaningful or not is a question.</description>

      <description>Single cell matrix is often represented as gene x cell in R/Seurat, but it is represented as cell x gene in python/scanpy.
Let’s use a real example to show how to transpose between the two formats. The GEO accession page is at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154763
Download the data We can use command line to download the count matrix at ftp: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE154nnn/GSE154763/suppl/
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE154nnn/GSE154763/suppl/GSE154763_ESCA_normalized_expression.csv.gz -O ~/blog_data/GSE154763_ESCA_normalized_expression.csv.gz # decompress the file gunzip GSE154763_ESCA_normalized_expression.csv.gz # this GEO matrix is cell x gene # take a look by https://www.</description>

      <description>Create a google VM Follow the process using the console https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance#console_1
Install docker Follow https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
Note this example for the debian build. If you created your VM using ubuntu as the boot disk, you should follow the ubuntu section https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/.
In the GCP VM:
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install \ ca-certificates \ curl \ gnupg \ lsb-release sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.</description>

      <title>Are PDL1 RNA and protein levels correlated in cancer cell lines?</title>

      <description>Are protein and RNA levels correlated? This is a big question.
see replies to this tweet at https://twitter.com/slavov_n/status/1561844133496512512. In general, RNA and protein abundances should be correlated but there are exceptions of course. Biology is complicated/weird!
 One of my favorite examples is Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, HIF-1α. The protein is efficiently degraded in most tissues most of the time unless stabilized by hypoxia.</description>

      <description>This is a blog post for a series of posts on marker gene identification using machine learning methods. Read the previous posts: logistic regression and partial least square regression.
This blog post will explore the tree based method: random forest and boost trees (gradient boost tree/XGboost). I highly recommend going through https://app.learney.me/maps/StatQuest for related sections by Josh Starmer. Note, all the tree based methods can be used to do both classification and regression.</description>

      <description>This is an extension of my last blog post marker gene selection using logistic regression and regularization for scRNAseq.
Let’s use the same PBMC single-cell RNAseq data as an example.
Load libraries
library(Seurat) library(tidyverse) library(tidymodels) library(scCustomize) # for plotting library(patchwork) Preprocess the data
# Load the PBMC dataset pbmc.data &amp;lt;- Read10X(data.dir = &amp;quot;~/blog_data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/&amp;quot;) # Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data). pbmc &amp;lt;- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = &amp;quot;pbmc3k&amp;quot;, min.</description>

      <guid>/post/marker-gene-selection-using-logistic-regression-and-regularization-for-scrnaseq/</guid>
      <description>why this blog post? I saw a biorxiv paper titled A comparison of marker gene selection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data
 Our results highlight the efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Student’s t-test and logistic regression
 I am interested in using logistic regression to find marker genes and want to try fitting the model in the tidymodel ecosystem and using different regularization methods.</description>

      <description>The CIMAC-CIDC Network is an NCI Cancer Moonshot initiative that provides cutting-edge technology and expertise in genomic, proteomic, and functional molecular analysis to enhance clinical trials in cancer immune therapies.
The four Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs) are at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Stanford University, MD Anderson, and Mount Sinai.
I am now leading the bioinformatics effort in the Cancer Immunologic Data Commons(CIDC) as part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot project on cancer immunotherapy.</description>
