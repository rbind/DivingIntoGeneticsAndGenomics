      <description>What does it do? For single cell ATACseq experiment, one gets a merged bam file for all cells. After going through clustering, one groups similar cells into cell types (cell states). This workflow will split the bam by clusters to create a pseudo bulk bam for each cluster, create bigwig tracks for visulization, call peaks for each cluster and merge the peaks across the clusters. Finally it will count reads per peak per cell from the original bam file on the merged peaks.</description>

      <description>Snakemake is a python extension for writing workflows. Genomics data processing usually requires bundling many different tools to reach a stage that is ready for downstream analysis.
I have been using snakemake writing workflows for various genomic and epigenomic datasets.
 ChIP-seq
 DNA-seq
 RNA-seq
 ATAC-seq
 RRBSeq
  The DNAseq Snakemake pipeline is the most complicated workflow I have written so far. I will need to think about refining it, modulizing it and adding conda env support.</description>
