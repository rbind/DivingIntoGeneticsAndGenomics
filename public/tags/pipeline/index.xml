      <description>Snakemake is a python extension for writing workflows. Genomics data processing usually requires bundling many different tools to reach a stage that is ready for downstream analysis.
I have been using snakemake writing workflows for various genomic and epigenomic datasets.
 pyflow-ChIP-seq
 DNA-seq
 pyflow-RNA-seq
 pyflow-ATAC-seq
 pyflow-RRBSeq
 pyflow-cellranger
 pyflow-scATACseq
  The DNAseq Snakemake pipeline is the most complicated workflow I have written so far. I will need to think about refining it, modulizing it and adding conda env support.</description>
