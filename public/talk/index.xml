      <description>In this 2-week long Harvard FAS informatics nanocourse, I co-taught snakemake for one afternoon and lead-instructed scRNAseq analysis for a full day.
 The snakemake workshop material was adapted from Titus Brown and can be found at https://github.com/crazyhottommy/2019-snakemake-Harvard-Informatics-nanocourse
 The scRNAseq workshop material was developed using workflowr and can be found at https://crazyhottommy.github.io/scRNA-seq-workshop-Fall-2019/
 The rest of the nanocourse material can be found at https://github.com/harvardinformatics/micro-course

      <description>I was invited to give a talk on reproducible bioinformatics research to the students in the Bunker Hill Community College in Boston, MA. I was so glad to introduce bioinformatics to the students and share my own perspectives on reproducible research.
The movie Good Will Hunting was shot there :)

      <description>I taught the ChIP-seq lesson for 2018 ANGUS Next-Gen Sequence Analysis Workshop held in UC Davis from 7/1/2018 to 7/14/2018, and TAed for the rest of the sessions. You can find my class link here and all the rest materials here. This is the first formal teaching I have done after I became a certified instructor for Data Carpentry. The same teaching skills applied!
Some tips for teaching:
 Be slow in pace Pause and have students ask questions Draw on white borad.</description>

      <description>I taught the ChIP-seq bioinformatics lab for the GS01 1143 Introduction to Bioinformatics course to ~30 people with diverse background. Some of them did not have any experience with terminals. I walked through the materials slowly and it was well received!
I developed the course materials here.
I plan to develope it to a Data Carpentry type of course materials, more work to come!
Enjoyed the teaching a lot!

      <description>I was excited to teach Shell and R to a group of 20 biologists from the University of Miami. This event was sponsored by Software carpentry https://software-carpentry.org/ and the University of Miami. see the course info here.
It was great teaching experience for me!
