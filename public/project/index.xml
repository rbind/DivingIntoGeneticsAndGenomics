      <description>The goal of scclusteval(Single Cell Cluster Evaluation) is to evaluate the single cell clustering stability by boostrapping/subsampling the cells and provide many visualization methods for comparing clusters.
for Theory behind the method, see Christian Henning, “Cluster-wise assessment of cluster stability,” Research Report 271, Dept. of Statistical Science, University College London, December 2006)
You can find the package at my github.</description>

      <description>Snakemake is a python extension for writing workflows. Genomics data processing usually requires bundling many different tools to reach a stage that is ready for downstream analysis.
I have been using snakemake writing workflows for various genomic and epigenomic datasets.
 ChIP-seq
 DNA-seq
 RNA-seq
 ATAC-seq
 RRBSeq
  The DNAseq Snakemake pipeline is the most complicated workflow I have written so far. I will need to think about refining it, modulizing it and adding conda env support.</description>
