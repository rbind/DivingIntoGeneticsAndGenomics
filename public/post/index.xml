      <description>In this blog post, I am going to show you how to make a correlation heatmap with p-values and significant values labeled in the heatmap body. Let’s use the PBMC single cell data as an example.
You may want to read my previous blog post How to do gene correlation for single-cell RNAseq data.

      <description>In my last blog post, I showed that pearson gene correlation for single-cell data has flaws because of the sparsity of the count matrix.
One way to get around it is to use the so called meta-cell. One can use KNN to find the K nearest neighbors and collapse them into a meta-cell. You can implement it from scratch, but one should not re-invent the wheel. For example, you can use metacells.</description>

      <description>Single cell matrix is often represented as gene x cell in R/Seurat, but it is represented as cell x gene in python/scanpy.
Let’s use a real example to show how to transpose between the two formats. The GEO accession page is at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154763
Download the data We can use command line to download the count matrix at ftp: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE154nnn/GSE154763/suppl/

      <description>Are protein and RNA levels correlated? This is a big question.
see replies to this tweet at https://twitter.com/slavov_n/status/1561844133496512512. In general, RNA and protein abundances should be correlated but there are exceptions of course. Biology is complicated/weird!
 One of my favorite examples is Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, HIF-1α. The protein is efficiently degraded in most tissues most of the time unless stabilized by hypoxia.</description>

      <description>This is a blog post for a series of posts on marker gene identification using machine learning methods. Read the previous posts: logistic regression and partial least square regression.
This blog post will explore the tree based method: random forest and boost trees (gradient boost tree/XGboost). I highly recommend going through https://app.learney.me/maps/StatQuest for related sections by Josh Starmer. Note, all the tree based methods can be used to do both classification and regression.</description>

      <description>I want to curate a public scRNAseq dataset from this paper Single-cell analyses reveal key immune cell subsets associated with response to PD-L1 blockade in triple-negative breast cancer
ffq I first tried ffq, but it gave me errors.
ffq fetches metadata information from the following databases:
 GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus, SRA: Sequence Read Archive, EMBL-EBI: European Molecular BIology Laboratory’s European BIoinformatics Institute, DDBJ: DNA Data Bank of Japan, NIH Biosample: Biological source materials used in experimental assays, ENCODE: The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements.</description>

      <description>why this blog post? I saw a biorxiv paper titled A comparison of marker gene selection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data
 Our results highlight the efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Student’s t-test and logistic regression
 I am interested in using logistic regression to find marker genes and want to try fitting the model in the tidymodel ecosystem and using different regularization methods.</description>

      <description>This is the end of 2021. I can not believe it has been 2 years since the pandemic. It is a challenging time for many of us. No matter what has happended, it is always good to sit down and spend some time to reflect for the past year. I wrote the annual review blog post every year, and you can find the one for 2020 at here.
Before I go to the details, I want to thank everyone who has helped me and mentored me in 2021.</description>

      <description>There are so many public datasets there waiting for us to mine! It is the blessing and cursing as a computational biologist!
Metadata, or the data describing (e.g., responder or non-responder for the treatment) the data are critical in interpreting the analysis. Without metadata, your data are useless.
People usually go to GEO or ENA to download public data. I asked this question on twitter, and I will show you how to get the metadata as suggested by all the awesome tweeps.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a really short blog post. I recently found that if I join two tables with one of the tables having duplicated rows, the final joined table also contains the duplicated rows. It could be the expected behavior for others but I want to make a note here for myself.
library(tidyverse) df1&amp;lt;- tibble(key = c(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;), value = 1:5) df1 ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## key value ## &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 ## 3 C 3 ## 4 D 4 ## 5 E 5 dataframe 2 has two identical rows for B.</description>

      <description>I am interested in learning more on matrix factorization and its application in scRNAseq data. I want to shout out to this paper: Enter the Matrix: Factorization Uncovers Knowledge from Omics by Elana J. Fertig group.
A matrix is decomposed to two matrices: the amplitude matrix and the pattern matrix. You can then do all sorts of things with the decomposed matrices. Single cell matrix is no special, one can use the matrix factorization techniques to derive interesting biological insights.</description>

      <description>I asked this question on Twitter:
 what test to test if two distributions are different? I am aware of KS test. When n is large (which is common in genomic studies), the p-value is always significant. better to test against an effect size? how to do it in this context?
 In genomics studies, it is very common to have large N (e.g., the number of introns, promoters in the genome, number of cells in the single-cell studies).</description>

      <description>Dotplot is a nice way to visualize scRNAseq expression data across clusters. It gives information (by color) for the average expression level across cells within the cluster and the percentage (by size of the dot) of the cells express that gene within the cluster.
Seurat has a nice function for that. However, it can not do the clustering for the rows and columns. David McGaughey has written a blog post using ggplot2 and ggtree from Guangchuang Yu.</description>

      <description>When it comes to make a heatmap, ComplexHeatmap by Zuguang Gu is my favorite. Check it out! You will be amazed on how flexible it is and the documentation is in top niche.
For Single-cell RNAseq, Seurat provides a DoHeatmap function using ggplot2. There are two limitations:
 when your genes are not in the top variable gene list, the scale.data will not have that gene and DoHeatmap will drop those genes.</description>

      <description>I wanted to set up Travis CI long time ago. Finally, I have a chance to do so. There are already many posts on how to do it. I write it down here for my own future reference. Thanks Tao Liu for the instructions. I have been learning a lot from him in collabrating with the MAESTRO project.
 read the official documentation https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/ Jean Fan&amp;rsquo;s blog post https://jef.works/blog/2019/02/17/automate-testing-of-your-R-package/ R specific https://docs.</description>

      <description>I was using the tidyverse rocker image on HPC by singularity pull. see my previous post.
Everything was OK until I encountered problems installing jpeg and Cairo R packages. Later, I also had an error installing scRepertoire dependency gsl.
It turns out I have to install debian packages inside the container:
$ apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y --no-install-recommends libjpeg62-turbo-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y --no-install-recommends libx11-dev libcairo2-dev libxt-dev \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y libgsl-dev  However, singularity file system is read-only.</description>

      <description>Seurat is great for scRNAseq analysis and it provides many easy-to-use ggplot2 wrappers for visualization. However, this brings the cost of flexibility. For example, In FeaturePlot, one can specify multiple genes and also split.by to further split to multiple the conditions in the meta.data. If split.by is not NULL, the ncol is ignored so you can not arrange the grid.
This is best to understand with an example.

      <guid>/post/stacked-violin-plot-for-visualizing-single-cell-data-in-seurat/</guid>
      <description>In scanpy, there is a function to create a stacked violin plot.
There is no such function in Seurat, and many people were asking for this feature. e.g. https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/300
https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/463
The developers have not implemented this feature yet. In this post, I am trying to make a stacked violin plot in Seurat.
The idea is to create a violin plot per gene using the VlnPlot in Seurat, then customize the axis text/tick and reduce the margin for each plot and finally concatenate by cowplot::plot_grid or patchwork::wrap_plots.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I tried to include transgenes to the cellranger reference and want to get the counts for the transgenes. However, even after I extended the Tdtomato and Cre with the potential 3’UTR, I still get very few cells express them. This is confusing to me.
My next thought is: maybe the STAR aligner is doing something weird that excluded those reads? At this point, I want to give kb-python, a python wrapper on kallisto and bustools a try.</description>

      <description>In a typical “barnyard” experiment in which cells from different species are mixed before loading to the 10x controller, the identification of the species of origin after mapping/counting with the hybrid reference is a problem. People tend to use the ratio of reads mapped to each reference genome to determine which species a cell is from.

 To deconvolute species, detect doublets and low quality cells, the mixed-species mapped data was used.</description>

The original ipython notebook can be found at https://github.com/vals/Blog/blob/master/171116-zero-inflation/Negative%20control%20analysis.ipynb
Thanks for writing those and put both the data and code in public. After I read Droplet scRNA-seq is not zero-inflated by Valentine Svensson, I want to gain some understanding of it. This post is an effort to replicate some of the analysis in the preprint using R. The original analysis was carried out in python.</description>

In an effort to better understand the distribution of single-cell RNAseq counts, I dived a bit deeper into the negative binomial distribution in the context of R. I am by no means an expert in statistics and writing this post is for myself to better understand it.

 Why Singularity? There are some important differences between Docker and Singularity:
  Docker and Singularity have their own container formats. Docker containers may be imported to run via Singularity. Docker containers need root privileges for full functionality which is not suitable for a shared HPC environment.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 01/29/2019. Read this awesome paper Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations.
This was an old post I wrote 3 years ago after I took HarvardX: PH525.3x Advanced Statistics for the Life Sciences on edx taught by Rafael Irizarry. It is still one of the best courses to get you started using R for genomics. I am very thankful to have those high quality classes available to me when I started to learn.</description>

      <description>PCA is a critical method for dimension reduction for high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). However, this is changing with single-cell RNAseq data. Now, we can sequence millions (n) of single cells and each cell has ~20,000 genes/features (p).
I suggest you read my previous blog post on using svd to calculate PCs.
Single-cell expression data PCA In single-cell RNAseq analysis, feature selection will be performed first.</description>

      <description>It is almost the end of 2018. It is a good time to review what I have achieved during the year and look forward to a brand new 2019. I wrote a similar post for 2017 here.
Some highlights of the year 2018:  My son Noah Tang was born in April. He is so lovely and we love him so much. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe he is almost 9 months old.</description>

      <description>You probably do not understand heatmap! Please read You probably don’t understand heatmaps by Mick Watson
In the blog post, Mick used heatmap function in the stats package, I will try to walk you through comparing heatmap, and heatmap.2 from gplots package.
Before I start, I want to quote this:
 “The defaults of almost every heat map function in R does the hierarchical clustering first, then scales the rows then displays the image”</description>

      <description>PCA in practice. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a very important skill for dimention reduction to analyze high-dimentional data. High-dimentional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). This types of data are very commonly generated from high-throuput sequencing experiments. For example, an RNA-seq or microarry experiment measures expression of tens of thousands of genes for only 8 samples (4 controls and 4 treatments).
Let’s use a microarray data for demonstration.</description>

      <description>featureCounts is a program to fast summarize counts from sequencing data. I use it to get gene-level RNAseq counts by
featureCounts -p -t exon -g gene_id -a annotation.gtf -o mysample_featureCount.txt mapping_results_PE.bam
If you have a lot of samples, you will get a lot of *featureCount.txt and you will need to merge them for downstream analysis.
I will show you how to merge the tables using R, python and unix below.</description>

      <description>During my daily work with R for genomic data analysis, I encountered several instances that R gives me some (bad) surprises.
1. The devil 1 and 0 coordinate system read detail here https://github.com/crazyhottommy/DNA-seq-analysis#tips-and-lessons-learned-during-my-dna-seq-data-analysis-journey
some files such as bed file is 0 based. Two genomic regions:
chr1 0 1000 chr1 1001 2000  when you import that bed file into R using rtracklayer::import(), it will become
chr1 1 1000 chr1 1002 2000  The function convert it to 1 based internally (R is 1 based unlike python).</description>

      <description>I am still suck at vim or emacs. I use nano to edit files on remote machines. But for more complicated editing, I prefer to use sublime.
use this https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl for editing remote files.
Steps:
on remote machine, install rmate ssh bio1 curl -o ~/bin/rmate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate chmod u+x bin/rmate  on your local computer, install RemoteSubl on your local computer, open sublime, click tools &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Command Palette &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; type Package control:Install Package &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; type RemoteSubl to install.</description>

 Harvard odyssey HPC requires a two-factor security login. First set up the VPN following here
 Then read about OpenAuth here. One can download mobile apps such as Duo and google-Authenticator on your phone, but then each time you will need to type the password to the terminal. Or you can download the java program for desktop, if you have a FAS research computing account, you should be able to download it from the link FASRC send you.</description>

customize terminal following this gist:
download iterm2 for mac here.
install on-my-zsh sh -c &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)&amp;quot;  You will have to install git first for the upper command to work. Now, when you fire up your terminal, it looks much more prettier! (there are many other schemes for oh my zsh, I found the default is good.</description>

      <description>Googling is a required technique for programmers. Once I have a programming problem in mind, the first thing I do is to google to see if other people have encountered the same problem and maybe they already have a solution. Do not re-invent the wheels. Actually, reading other people’s code and mimicing their code is a great way of learning. Today, I am going to show you how to compute binned averages/sums along a genome or any genomic regions of interest.</description>

Note that you do not knit the Rmarkdown by yourself, rather you let blogdown do the heavy lift.

It is quite straightforward to have a working site following Alison&amp;rsquo;s guide. However, you always want some customization of your own site.
I took the tips from Leslie.
changed the menue bar to black. I like it better than the default white. in the config.toml file, change the theme:</description>

      <description>Data backup is an essential step in the data analysis life cycle. As shown in a pic below taken from DataOne.
There are so many important things you may want to back up: your raw/processed data, your code, and your dot configuration files. While for every project, I have git version control my scripts (not the data) and push it to github or gitlab to have a backup, big files can not be hosted on github or gitlab.</description>
