      <description>I am starting my first day at Harvard FAS informatics and I will keep a note here on how I set up my new laptop.
customize terminal following this gist:

      <description>Googling is a required technique for programmers. Once I have a programming problem in mind, the first thing I do is to google to see if other people have encountered the same problem and maybe they already have a solution. Do not re-invent the wheels. Actually, reading other people’s code and mimicing their code is a great way of learning. Today, I am going to show you how to compute binned averages/sums along a genome or any genomic regions of interest.</description>

      <description>I have used blogdown writing regular markdown posts, but the real power is from the Rmarkdown! let me try it for this post.
Note that you do not knit the Rmarkdown by yourself, rather you let blogdown do the heavy lift.

      <description>I have been following this tutorial from Alison and tips from Leslie Myint for some customization for deploying my blogdown website
It is quite straightforward to have a working site following Alison&amp;rsquo;s guide. However, you always want some customization of your own site.

While for every project, I have git version control my scripts (not the data) and push it to github or gitlab to have a backup, big files can not be hosted on github or gitlab.</description>
