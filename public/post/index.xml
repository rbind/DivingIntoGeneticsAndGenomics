      <description>I have used blogdown writing regular markdown posts, but the real power is from the Rmarkdown! let me try it for this post.
Note that you do not knit the Rmarkdown by yourself, rather you let blogdown do the heavy lift.

      <description>Data backup is an essential step in the data analysis life cycle. As shown in a pic below taken from DataOne.
