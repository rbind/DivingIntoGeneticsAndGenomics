      <description>Why guest posting? I want to write more hands-on tutorials, but I realized:
 I am not an expert for every data type. I am too busy to write new ones.  So that&amp;rsquo;s why I started to experiment guest posting!

      <description>Spatial transcriptome cellular niche analysis using 10x xenium data go to https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets
There is a lung cancer and a breast cancer dataset. Let’s work on the lung cancer one.

 read in the data with Seurat We really only care about the cell by gene count matrix which is inside the cell_feature_matrix folder, and the cell location x,y coordinates: cells.</description>

In a previous blog post, I showed you how to make a Seurat spatial object from Vizgen spatial transcriptome data. In this post, I am going to show you how to identify clusters of neighborhood or cellular niches where specific cell types tend to co-localize.
 read in the data and pre-process library(Seurat) library(here) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) # the LoadVizgen function requires the raw segmentation files which is too big.</description>

Single-cell spatial transcriptome data is a new and advanced technology that combines the study of individual cells’ genes and their location in a tissue to understand the complex cellular and molecular differences within it. This allows scientists to investigate how genes are expressed and how cells interact with each other with much greater detail than before.</description>
