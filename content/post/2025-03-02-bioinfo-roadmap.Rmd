## You Can Change Your Appetites  

Linear algebra, statistics, machine learningâ€”these used to feel abstract to me. I had zero experience of bioinformatics when I was studying my PhD in a wet lab.

I memorized formulas without truly understanding them. But over time, I found the right resources that made these concepts click, especially in the context of bioinformatics.  

I wrote a blog post: [My opinionated selection of books/urls for bioinformatics/data science curriculum](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/my-opinionated-selection-of-books-for-bioinformatics-data-science-curriculum/) six years ago, and many links are broken. so I decided to write a new one.

If I were starting my bioinformatics/computational journey again 12 years ago, here are the **FREE** resources I would recommend.

## 1. Master the Linux Command Line  

Knowing how to work in a Unix environment is a must for any bioinformatician. Start with these:  

- **[Software Carpentry UNIX Shell Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3iNcBtycaQ&list=PLA86D04D6E0BFD2E0)** â€“ My first introduction to Unix. It's old but still solid.  
- **[How Linux Works (Book)](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks3)** â€“ A great deep dive into how Linux operates.  
- **[Data Science at the Command Line (Book)](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/)** â€“ Fun read with lots of useful tricks.  
- **[Practice in a Bioinformatics Sandbox](https://sandbox.bio/)** â€“ Great for hands-on command-line practice.  

---

## 2. Learn R for Genomics  

R is an essential tool for bioinformatics, especially for data wrangling and visualization.  

- **[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)** â€“ Learn `tidyverse`, master data manipulation, and reshape data efficiently.  

- **[Data Analysis for the Life Sciences with R](https://www.crcpress.com/Data-Analysis-for-the-Life-Sciences-with-R/Irizarry-Love/p/book/9781498775670)** â€“ I took this course 3 times and learned a ton!  

- **[Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/)** â€“ Practical applications of genomics with R.  

- **[Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bioinformatics-data-skills/9781449367480/)** â€“ A must-have for anyone serious about bioinformatics. It covers unix, R and python.

## 3. Build a Strong Statistical Foundation  

Understanding statistics is critical. These books and videos will help:  

- **[Discovering Statistics with R](https://www.discovr.rocks/)** â€“ A fantastic and engaging stats book (2nd edition coming soon).

- **[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/)** â€“ A great resource for statistical applications in biology.  

- **[StatQuest by Josh Starmer](https://statquest.org/video-index/)** â€“ Iâ€™ve watched the PCA video at least 20 times.  

---

## 4. Linear Algebra: Make It Click  

I never understood eigenvectors and eigenvaluesâ€”until I found these:  

- **[3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra Videos](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)** â€“ The best visual explanations of matrix transformations.  
- **[MIT 18.06: Linear Algebra](https://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/)** â€“ A formal, in-depth introduction to linear algebra.  

Why it is important to learn linear algebra? Most of the genomics data are just matrices:

* an RNAseq expression matrix is a gene-by-sample matrix, with entries to be read counts for each gene
* a single-cell expression matrix is a gene-by-cell matrix, with entries to be read counts for each gene
* a ChIP-seq count matrix is a peak-by-sample matrix, with entries to be the number of reads in each peak
* a drug response matrix is a drug-by-sample matrix, with entries to be IC50 for example

and many moreâ€¦ in other words,

Matrix is **EVERYWHERE** for bioinformatics (and many other data science topics)!

Many of the bioinformatics problems can be rephrased as matrix manipulation.

Understand what does matrix multiplication mean deeply; Why matrix factorization is useful for genomics (see my [post](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/matrix-factorization-for-single-cell-rnaseq-data/)). 

Matrix calculation is also the foundation of deep learning!

## 5. Get Comfortable with Machine Learning  

Statistics and machine learning go hand in hand:  

- **[StatQuest ML Videos](https://statquest.org/video-index/)** â€“ Clear explanations of PCA, regression, decision trees, SVM and more.  

- **[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)** â€“ One of the best ML books, now with R and Python editions.  

---

## 6. Python for Bioinformatics  

Iâ€™m primarily an R user, but I use Python for workflow automation. If I had to start again:  

- **[Python for Biologists](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/dp/1492346136)** â€“ A great beginner-friendly book.  

- **[Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for Beginners](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics)** â€“ I took this Coursera course and found it useful.

## Just Start!  

Pick any resource that fits your learning stage and dive in. **Waiting wonâ€™t change anything. Taking action will.** Those who start and experiment win in bioinformatics.  

of course, subscribe to my youtube channel chatomics to learn bioinformatics too! https://www.youtube.com/@chatomics
