abstract = "VEGF is a pivotal pro-angiogenic growth factor and its dosage decisively impacts vascularization. We recently identified a CTCF-dependent chromatin insulator that critically restrains the transcriptional induction of VEGF and angiogenesis. We postulate that CTCF may exert enhancer blocking by mediating chromatin looping and/or RNA polymerase pausing at the VEGF locus."
