The Bioinformatics Computational Biology Association (BCBA) is excited to host Dr. Ming Tommy Tang, Director of Bioinformatics at AstraZeneca and founder of the science blog Diving into Genetics and Genomics.

Join us on Tuesday, May 6th at 5:30 PM in ILSB 302 for a special career-focused seminar where Dr. Tang will share his journey across academia, biotech, and pharma:

Earning his PhD in molecular cancer biology at the University of Florida and postdoctoral training at MD Anderson Cancer Center

Transitioning to non-tenure track faculty roles at Harvard FAS Informatics and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute

Building and leading the computational biology team at Immunitas Therapeutics, where he applied single-cell RNAseq and TCRseq to study the tumor microenvironment

His current leadership role at AstraZeneca, heading the epigenetics bioinformatics effort to drive the Epigenetics Oncology portfolio toward the clinic with actionable bioinformatics insights

His passion for open science, bioinformatics education, and empowering biologists with computational skills

With over a decade of experience in genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, Dr. Tang brings a wealth of expertise at the intersection of biology and computation.
More about his work can be found at divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com.

Dr. Tang will also share practical career advice for students interested in biology, bioinformatics, computer science, and STEM fields â€” especially valuable for juniors, seniors, and students exploring industry careers.

We highly encourage anyone interested in bioinformatics, genomics, computational biology, or science careers to attend!
