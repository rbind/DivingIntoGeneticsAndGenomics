Storytelling is a superpower. And ðŸŽ¯ Ming "Tommy" Tang has it.

Heâ€™s been a prolific name in hashtag#bioinformatics, stemming from his early days spent documenting his journey into the field through his personal blog  (
https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/). And it was an absolute pleasure having him on the Bioinformatics Lab Podcast.

In our episode, we cover scientific communication, foundational skills required in bioinformatics, our transitions from from wet lab to dry lab, in-person v. remote work environments, startup v. larger company dynamics, the impact of AI for both developers and analysts, and some of the underpinnings of Tommyâ€™s optimistic and resilient worldview.
