Weâ€™re bringing a podcast to the conversation: AI on the Hill â€” and our very first episode is now live!

In this show, host RenÃ© BastÃ³n sits down with ðŸŽ¯ Ming "Tommy" Tang, a first-gen PhD who arrived in the U.S. with just $2,000 and a dream. Through grit, coding, and a passion for open science, he transformed his career â€” and became a voice for how AI is reshaping drug discovery.

They talk about:

âœ… Breaking into coding as a scientist. 

âœ… How AI and data are reshaping drug discovery. 

âœ… The value of open science and reproducibility. 

âœ… Turning struggle into momentum and leadership
