Snakemake is a python extension for writing workflows. Genomics data processing usually requires bundling many different tools to reach a stage that is ready for downstream analysis.

I have been using snakemake writing workflows for various genomic and epigenomic datasets.

* [pyflow-ChIP-seq](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow-ChIPseq)

* [DNA-seq](https://gitlab.com/tangming2005/snakemake_DNAseq_pipeline/tree/multiRG)

* [pyflow-RNA-seq](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow-RNAseq)

* [pyflow-ATAC-seq](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow-ATACseq)

* [pyflow-RRBSeq](https://gitlab.com/tangming2005/pyflow-RRBSeq)

* [pyflow-cellranger](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow-cellranger)

* [pyflow-scATACseq](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow-scATACseq)

The DNAseq Snakemake pipeline is the most complicated workflow I have written so far. I will need to think about refining it, modulizing it and adding conda env support. Eventually, I will need to put all the snakemake workflows togther using something like [snakeparse](https://github.com/nh13/snakeparse)
