## ✍️ Writing for Featured Snippets

### Question-Answer Format

**Target questions that get featured snippets:**

```markdown
## What is the difference between FDR and q-value?

**FDR (False Discovery Rate)** is the expected proportion of false positives among
rejected hypotheses, while **q-value** is the minimum FDR at which a test is called
significant.

In practical terms:
- **FDR**: Controls the overall rate of false discoveries
- **q-value**: The FDR threshold for each individual test
- **Example**: A q-value of 0.05 means this result is significant at FDR ≤ 5%

### List Format (Numbered/Bulleted)

**Google loves lists:**

```markdown
## 5 Common Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis Mistakes

### 1. Using Cell-Level Statistics Instead of Pseudobulk

**The Problem**: Treating cells as independent samples inflates statistical power...

**The Fix**: Aggregate cells into pseudobulk samples before differential expression...

**Code Example**:
[R code here]
```

### Comparison Table Format

```markdown
## Seurat vs Scanpy: Quick Comparison

| Feature | Seurat | Scanpy |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Language | R | Python |
| Speed | Moderate | Fast |
| Visualization | Excellent | Good |
| Community | Large | Growing |

**Choose Seurat if**: You work primarily in R and need publication-quality plots...
**Choose Scanpy if**: You work in Python and prioritize speed for large datasets...
